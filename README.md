# Workout Tracker
An application to keep track of all your workouts and exercises. The app is built with Ruby on Rails. Uses OAuth to allow a user to login via Facebook.

# Motivation
I created this app to help other people as well as myself to help keep track of workouts and exercises. Users are able to create workouts with associated exercises. Organized with dates and includes a filter feature, for example, workouts including 'Arms and Back'.

# Highlights
-Developed with the Ruby on Rails framework.
-Included Active Record associations. Made use of a nested resource with
the appropriate RESTful URLs as well as validations for attributes to
defend against invalid data.
-Utilized OAuth to allow users to login via Facebook and provided
standard user authentication including signup, login, logout, and
passwords using the Devise gem.
